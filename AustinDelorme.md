# Introduction #
Austin Delorme is the mercurial master for the team. He barely understood it when it was introduced, so he was designated to be in charge of it.


# Details #

Austin lives on the ASU Polytechnic campus, where he is studying Applied Computer Science. A lot of his code is sort of haphazardly thrown together, and he gets excited when it happens to work. Some other facts about Austin:
  * He has two sisters, and is the middle child
  * Got second place in a spelling bee in 6th grade
  * Once opened the microwave before the beep, but after the timer hit 0. This achievement is his pride and joy.
  * Plays with Alexâ€™s dog.
