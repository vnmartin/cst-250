Finished Part 1 of project on 3/20/2013

**Had issues getting the logic down but once we did seem to flow well.**

Finished Part 2 of project on 4/9/2013

**Addition and multiplication went very well, but multiplication did not!! We finally with a little help from Sid came to the answer.**

Finished Part 3 of project on 4/21/2013

**In trying to cover exemptions we discovered that our logic was completely off, in order to store numbers large enough. I should say our logic was backwards. We fixed that and went into the exceptions everything worked well. We are still finding small bugs in our logic and working on them but all in all the project I would grade as a great success.**

This project was a good learning experience but also a very brain numbing experience all wrapped into one!!

**Special Thanks to our programmer genius RUSS PARMER!! Who was the superstar of the team.**

We hope you all enjoy the show!!!
